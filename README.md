When I'm not breaking into things professionally, I'm building tools that make the job easier — or watching SPY options do their thing.

## 🔧 What I Build

### Offensive Security Tooling
- **[ResponderSluiceBoxCleaner](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/ResponderSluiceBoxCleaner)** — Like panning for gold. Sifts through Responder hash captures, deduplicates, and outputs clean hashes ready to crack.
- **[1-1-LinerToRuleThemAll](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/1-1-LinerToRuleThemAll)** — Pentest one-liner compilation. I didn't make these, but I sure did copy/paste them.
- **[YesNoVNC](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/YesNoVNC)** — Sets up NoVNC so it actually works with one (double) click. Browser-based VNC for Kali Linux.
- **[CivicPlusPlus](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/CivicPlusPlus)** — OSINT tool for finding city websites on the Civic Plus platform and extracting staff directory info.

### AI + Automation
- **[Claude-Desktop-Kali-Setup](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/Claude-Desktop-Kali-Setup)** — One-command installer for Claude Desktop + MCP servers on Kali Linux/Debian/Ubuntu. APT repo, GPG keys, and MCP server integration — all automatic.

### Trading
- **[SPYderScalp](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/SPYderScalp)** — SPY intraday 0-2 DTE options signal monitor with multi-indicator quality scoring, multi-timeframe confirmation, prediction tracking, and an options value scanner.
