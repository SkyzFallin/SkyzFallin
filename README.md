##  What I Build

### Offensive Security Tooling
- **[ResponderSluiceBoxCleaner](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/ResponderSluiceBoxCleaner)** — Like panning for gold. Sifts through Responder hash captures, deduplicates, and outputs clean hashes ready to crack.
- **[1-1-LinerToRuleThemAll](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/1-1-LinerToRuleThemAll)** — Pentest one-liner compilation. I didn't make these, but I sure did copy/paste them.
- **[YesNoVNC](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/YesNoVNC)** — Sets up NoVNC so it actually works with one (double) click. Browser-based VNC for Kali Linux.
- **[CivicPlusPlus](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/CivicPlusPlus)** — OSINT tool for finding city/county/state websites using the popular "Civic Plus" platform and extracting IT employee info for phishing and sales. Motivation: Kevin is the best sales guy ever.

### AI + Automation
- **[Claude-Desktop-Kali-Setup](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/Claude-Desktop-Kali-Setup)** — One-command installer for Claude Desktop + MCP servers on Kali Linux/Debian/Ubuntu. APT repo, GPG keys, and MCP server integration — all automatic.

### Trading
- **[SPYderScalp](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/SPYderScalp)** — SPY intraday 0-2 DTE options signal monitor with multi-indicator quality scoring, multi-timeframe confirmation, prediction tracking, and an options value scanner.
- **[SKYZ-SPY-Scalper](https://github.com/SkyzFallin/SKYZ-SPY-Scalper)** — 1-minute optimized SPY scalping indicator for Webull. EMA trend alignment, pullback entries, RSI/volume filters, and ATR-based risk framework.
